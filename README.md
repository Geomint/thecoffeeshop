## User Experience: üëç

### Project Goals:
<p>The goal of this project is to offer a wide range of coffee products be it ground coffee, coffee beans or even products & merchandise. The users on the website will be able to create an account, add any combination of items
to a shopping basket, make payments and have their orders viewable on their profile dashboard panel.</p>

### Target Audience Goals:

* Browse various coffee products and be offered information about that product.
* Purchase products shown on the webstore.
* Create an account to track orders and purchase items on the webstore.
* A visually appealing and intuitive design.
* A website that is navigable on any device (mobile/tablet/desktop).
* Track orders made via profile dashboard.

### Site Owner Goals:

* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Encourage user sales with promotions and discounts.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract coffee suppliers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.

### User Stories:

<p>Tim Says: "Ive been looking for a website for a while now that works just as well on my phone as it does my laptop, im far too busy to be sitting at my computer all day 
so I need a site that I can use just as well on my phone."</p>

<p>Mark Says: "Im often skeptical of purchasing on online sites, I like to know that I have a line of communication with the company im paying with just incase there would be an issue
at some point down the line with the order."</p>

<p>Gabe Says: "Shopping on an e-commerce website has got to be easy, if you flood the user with too much choice you can cause them to panic and potentially leave the site and go elsewhere,
make it easy for the user to choose which items they want and buy them, simple!"</p>

### User Requirements and Expectations:
<p>When it comes to shopping on the web, users need to feel safe & comfortable in order for them to actually go through with purchases online, therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication
and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.</p>

#### Requirements:

* Interact with a visually appealing and intuitive website.
* Navigate the website on any device, with ease.
* Consume information about various coffee types and about the brand.
* Add products to a shopping cart & update the cart quantities.
* Purchase products in the shopping cart in a safe and secure way.
* View orders in profile dashboard section.
* Can reach out to the business via email if needed.

#### Expectations:

* The Website will ensure safe storage of user details.
* The users payment information will not be stored in the website's database.
* The Website will load with sufficient speed.
* The Content on the website will be dynamic for any device.
* The Website will be navigable with ease.

## Design Choices: üé®
<p>I wanted the design of this website to reflect the rustic feel of a family run coffee shop, the pastel colours and various brown colours compliment the imagery used across the site.</p>

### Fonts:

<p>I chose to use Montserrat as the main font family for this website as it provides an elegant & clean style for text and titles. In the essence of keeping the layout clean to encourage user sales, I decided to go with this font.</p>

### Icons:

<p>Thanks to the excellent collection of icons over at font-awesome, selecting icons to use for The Coffee Shop was really simple, I decided to go with typical icons for the 'icon-navigation' section of the navbar, the cart, the user icon and the burger button, as well as using various other intutitive icons across the project. I use icons in place of link text across the site where possible to provide the best UX possible to the user.</p>

### Colours:
<p>The colours I chose to use for this website compliment the rustic tones of a coffee shop, having a visually appealing contrast provides a more elegant user experience for those on the website, below is the list of colours the website uses.</p>

- ![#b2e4c8](https://placehold.it/15/b2e4c8/000000?text=+) Primary: #b2e4c8; "Fringy Flower" - This pastel green colour provides an elegant & efficient contrast for the strong brown colour.
- ![#58493c](https://placehold.it/15/58493c/000000?text=+) Secondary: #58493c; "Kabul" - This strong brown colour is used across the site in the layout, for instance the header and footer, this defines the page well and indicates where the user focus should be.
- ![#f1e2d0](https://placehold.it/15/f1e2d0/000000?text=+) Tertiary: #f1e2d0; "Almond" - This lighter brown colour provides a subtle alternative to the stronger brown and can be used to highlight various elements within the website. 
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) White Colour: #ffffff; "White" - This is the standard white colour on the website.
- ![#f2f2f2](https://placehold.it/15/f2f2f2/000000?text=+) Off White Colour: #f2f2f2; "Concrete" - This off white colour provides sufficient layout differences between the white page background.
- ![#017735](https://placehold.it/15/017735/000000?text=+) Text On White Colour: #017735; "Fun Green" - This is a somewhat darker variation of the primary colour to be used when text is positioned on a white background.
- ![#000](https://placehold.it/15/b2e4c8/000000?text=+) Black Colour: #000; "Black" - This is the standard black colour on the website.
- ![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) Required Colour: #ff0000; "Required" - This is the standard red colour to be used for required symbols.
- ![#cc0000](https://placehold.it/15/cc0000/000000?text=+) Error Colour: #cc0000; "Guardsman Red" - This is the standard red colour to be used to indicate errors, it is a somewhat stronger red than the last to indicate to the user that something has gone wrong.
- ![#25bd2c](https://placehold.it/15/25bd2c/000000?text=+) Success Colour: #25bd2c; "Success" - This is the standard green colour to be used to indicate successful interactions on the website.

### Images:
<p>The images used across the website have been sourced from royalty free image website such as <a href="https://unsplash.com/">this</a>. The images are related to coffee in some way be it baristas, coffee displays or even ground coffee. This helps to provide lifestyle imagery to the user and potentially entice them into making a purchase.</p>

## Wireframes/Flowcharts: üîß
<p>I used <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> to develop the wireframes for The Coffee Shop website, this seemless tool allowed me to easily make a wireframe for each page aswell as a wireframe for each device. I could then easily export them via the tool to .png files in order to save to the project.</p> 

<p>The wireframes for this project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/Geomint/thecofffeeshop/tree/master/wireframes">here</a></p>

### Account Creation Flowchart:

<p>The account creation flowchart for this project can be viewed here <a href="https://github.com/Geomint/thecofffeeshop/tree/master/wireframes/account_auth_flowchart.png">here</a></p>

### Database Design:

* During development of The Coffee Shop I worked with the standard <strong>sqlite3</strong> database that comes installed with Django.
* In the production version of The Coffee Shop, the database is a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database, hosted and provided by Heroku.

Read more about the sendgrid integration in the planning & testing section below.</p>
