## User Experience: üëç

### Project Goals:
<p>The goal of this project is to offer a wide range of coffee products be it ground coffee, coffee beans or even products & merchandise. The users on the website will be able to create an account, add any combination of items
to a shopping basket, make payments and have their orders viewable on their profile dashboard panel.</p>

### Target Audience Goals:

* Browse various coffee products and be offered information about that product.
* Purchase products shown on the webstore.
* Create an account to track orders and purchase items on the webstore.
* A visually appealing and intuitive design.
* A website that is navigable on any device (mobile/tablet/desktop).
* Track orders made via profile dashboard.

### Site Owner Goals:

* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Encourage user sales with promotions and discounts.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract coffee suppliers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.

### User Stories:

<p>Tim Says: "Ive been looking for a website for a while now that works just as well on my phone as it does my laptop, im far too busy to be sitting at my computer all day 
so I need a site that I can use just as well on my phone."</p>

<p>Mark Says: "Im often skeptical of purchasing on online sites, I like to know that I have a line of communication with the company im paying with just incase there would be an issue
at some point down the line with the order."</p>

<p>Gabe Says: "Shopping on an e-commerce website has got to be easy, if you flood the user with too much choice you can cause them to panic and potentially leave the site and go elsewhere,
make it easy for the user to choose which items they want and buy them, simple!"</p>

### User Requirements and Expectations:
<p>When it comes to shopping on the web, users need to feel safe & comfortable in order for them to actually go through with purchases online, therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication
and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.</p>

#### Requirements:

* Interact with a visually appealing and intuitive website.
* Navigate the website on any device, with ease.
* Consume information about various coffee types and about the brand.
* Add products to a shopping cart & update the cart quantities.
* Purchase products in the shopping cart in a safe and secure way.
* View orders in profile dashboard section.
* Can reach out to the business via email if needed.

#### Expectations:

* The Website will ensure safe storage of user details.
* The users payment information will not be stored in the website's database.
* The Website will load with sufficient speed.
* The Content on the website will be dynamic for any device.
* The Website will be navigable with ease.

## Design Choices: üé®
<p>I wanted the design of this website to reflect the rustic feel of a family run coffee shop, the pastel colours and various brown colours compliment the imagery used across the site.</p>

### Fonts:

<p>I chose to use Montserrat as the main font family for this website as it provides an elegant & clean style for text and titles. In the essence of keeping the layout clean to encourage user sales, I decided to go with this font.</p>

### Icons:

<p>Thanks to the excellent collection of icons over at font-awesome, selecting icons to use for The Coffee Shop was really simple, I decided to go with typical icons for the 'icon-navigation' section of the navbar, the cart, the user icon and the burger button, as well as using various other intutitive icons across the project. I use icons in place of link text across the site where possible to provide the best UX possible to the user.</p>

### Colours:
<p>The colours I chose to use for this website compliment the rustic tones of a coffee shop, having a visually appealing contrast provides a more elegant user experience for those on the website, below is the list of colours the website uses.</p>

- ![#b2e4c8](https://placehold.it/15/b2e4c8/000000?text=+) Primary: #b2e4c8; "Fringy Flower" - This pastel green colour provides an elegant & efficient contrast for the strong brown colour.
- ![#58493c](https://placehold.it/15/58493c/000000?text=+) Secondary: #58493c; "Kabul" - This strong brown colour is used across the site in the layout, for instance the header and footer, this defines the page well and indicates where the user focus should be.
- ![#f1e2d0](https://placehold.it/15/f1e2d0/000000?text=+) Tertiary: #f1e2d0; "Almond" - This lighter brown colour provides a subtle alternative to the stronger brown and can be used to highlight various elements within the website. 
- ![#ffffff](https://placehold.it/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) White Colour: #ffffff; "White" - This is the standard white colour on the website.
- ![#f2f2f2](https://placehold.it/15/f2f2f2/000000?text=+) Off White Colour: #f2f2f2; "Concrete" - This off white colour provides sufficient layout differences between the white page background.
- ![#017735](https://placehold.it/15/017735/000000?text=+) Text On White Colour: #017735; "Fun Green" - This is a somewhat darker variation of the primary colour to be used when text is positioned on a white background.
- ![#000](https://placehold.it/15/b2e4c8/000000?text=+) Black Colour: #000; "Black" - This is the standard black colour on the website.
- ![#ff0000](https://placehold.it/15/ff0000/000000?text=+) Required Colour: #ff0000; "Required" - This is the standard red colour to be used for required symbols.
- ![#cc0000](https://placehold.it/15/cc0000/000000?text=+) Error Colour: #cc0000; "Guardsman Red" - This is the standard red colour to be used to indicate errors, it is a somewhat stronger red than the last to indicate to the user that something has gone wrong.
- ![#25bd2c](https://placehold.it/15/25bd2c/000000?text=+) Success Colour: #25bd2c; "Success" - This is the standard green colour to be used to indicate successful interactions on the website.

The images are related to coffee in some way be it baristas, coffee displays or even ground coffee. This helps to provide lifestyle imagery to the user and potentially entice them into making a purchase.</p>

## Wireframes/Flowcharts: üîß
<p>I used <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a> to develop the wireframes for The Coffee Shop website, this seemless tool allowed me to easily make a wireframe for each page aswell as a wireframe for each device. I could then easily export them via the tool to .png files in order to save to the project.</p> 

<p>The wireframes for this project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/Geomint/thecofffeeshop/tree/master/wireframes">here</a></p>

### Account Creation Flowchart:

<p>The account creation flowchart for this project can be viewed here <a href="https://github.com/Geomint/thecofffeeshop/tree/master/wireframes/account_auth_flowchart.png">here</a></p>

### Database Design:

* During development of The Coffee Shop I worked with the standard <strong>sqlite3</strong> database that comes installed with Django.
* In the production version of The Coffee Shop, the database is a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database, hosted and provided by Heroku.

### The Coffee Shop Data Models:

## Planning:  + Testing: ‚úèÔ∏è üîå

#### Planning: 

<p>Planning for this project was extremely important, using and utilising new technology, frameworks, APIs and other tools can often be a challenge if you lack the correct preperation, continue reading to find out how each feature of The Coffee Shop was planned, tested, and how the feature works within the scope of the website.</p>

<p>Using the wireframes I built using sketch I was able to quickly build a base layout for the website, utilising component files where possible in order to provide resuable code in multiple areas across the website, thanks to the templating language that comes as standard with Django, this was an easy task.</p>

#### Feature Testing üé°: 

<strong>Contact Form (using Sendgrid Api)</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
I wanted to create a contact form in which users on the website could send messages to the business, I have previously built contact forms which just provide the user with a dummy message to say that the message has been recieved, here however I wanted to take advantage of the excellent service Sendgrid provides and actually allow my users to send messages to an inbox.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
Using the documentation provided by Django and Sendgrid, setting up the contact form was relatively simple, adding the following settings to my 'settings.py' 
```python
SENDGRID_API_KEY = os.getenv('SENDGRID_API_KEY')
EMAIL_HOST = '<sendgrid_host_here>'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'apikey'  # this is exactly the value 'apikey'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = SENDGRID_API_KEY
EMAIL_PORT = <ports_here>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
``` 
- in order to access the sendgrid API. From within the dashboard of sendgrid I had to set up a verified sender in order to allow messages to be sent in from the form. There are 3 cname records that need to be set at the Domain level in order to allow any sender email to be inputted into the contact form, this exceeded the scope of the requirements for the project as I dont have access to a domain for TheCoffeeShop, just what heroku provided, therefore the only sender email currently available to use on the contact form is "george.pyott@googlemail.com".

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test this feature I had to ensure that the above settings were correct in the settings.py file, and input a dummy message into the contact form making sure that the email is 'george.pyott@googlemail.com'.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
Using the dashboard that SendGrid provides, I could see that the email had been sent using their services, and within the inbox specified I could see the message sent from the contact form within The Coffee Shop.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
Whilst this feature works in the scope of the project criteria, In the future if The Coffee Shop were deployed to a none Heroku domain, I would add the necessary records to the DNS so that any email could be used as a registered sender.

<strong>Product List Page</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
An e-commerce site always needs a product list page so that the users can browse through the selection of products the business has to offer, therefore a large portion of planning went into this page in terms of have the correct layout in order to provide the best user experience possible. I wanted to include a level of pagination to this page so that the site could have a vast array of products without making the main product list page load times too long.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
Once I had setup the product model and migrate the table into the database, I could then create the view within the products app that sends a GET request to the database and returns all the products into the products variable, making this available to the front end via the context in the return statement meant that I could loop through each product from the database and render the details using Djangos template language in the HTML. Using the paginator tool from django I was able to simply set how many products I wanted to show per page and render the pagination buttons in the HTML.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test that this feature worked, I navigated to the 'products.html' page and looked to see if all the products in the database had been rendered into the HTML, I added enough products so that the paginator would fire, 7 to be precise as the paginator will only show 6 per page.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
All products within the database were correctly rendered to the 'products.html' page, and the paginator correctly takes the user to the next page showing the 7th product.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test has passed based on the above information and criteria.

<strong>Product View Page (detailed view)</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
Aswell as having a product list view where the user can see a list of all the products currently in the database, I wanted to include a product detail page, that ther user could navigate to and read more information about the clicked product, further on in production this would allow the business to include more detail about the product, the brand and any other information on this page too. This would be the page that the user makes the final decision, and add to the cart a specified quantity.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
Passing in the primary Key of the product (primary key in the database), via the URL meant that I could select the product from the database when the product is clicked by the user, this allowed me to build up a page with ONLY the product the user had clicked on.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test this feature I had to navigate to the product list page and click on any of the products available, once the page had loaded and the product information was there, I checked the url to see what ID the website had taken to me, comparing this to what information was in the database.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
The page rendered accuratley with the previously clicked product information, I could then interact with the elements on the page to find out more about the product and add the item to a cart.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.


<strong>Cart (add-to, edit-cart, view-cart)</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
You can't have an e-commerce website without a functioning shopping cart, therefore planning and testing for this feature was important. I wanted to cart to be available to any user, not just those signed in as in business terms this would mean that there is a higher chance people would buy items due to not having to enter contact details to browse, also gathering session information is an important part of e-commerce research.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
I had to build a context.py file within the cart app and include this within the context processors section within templates in the settings.py file, this is to tell the app what the cart should look like by default and what information should be available to it. This is also required as the cart is not stored in the database, but rather in the session. Once this was done, I could write the view function for Adding to the cart, Editing the quantity in the cart, and Viewing the cart contents.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test these cart features I had to do the following:
* * 1: Navigate to the product list page and click through to a product detail view page, then I attempted to add 2 of the item to the cart.
* * 2: Wait to see if the returned page was the cart.html page with 2 lots of the product I had just added.
* * 3: Edit the quantity of the items in the cart to 1 and update the cart.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
The website correctly added 2 of the clicked products to the cart session, and the cart.html page was rendered with those items in. Upon editing the quantity of the item to 1 and hitting submit, the cart page was reloaded with just 1 of the item not remaining in the cart.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.

<strong>Checkout (using the STRIPE API)</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
Being able to checkout products on an e-commerce is also a must, infact its a requirement, and users have a full expectation that the website they are using will handle their sensitive information with care and conform to the legal guidelines. This feature needed to work seemlessly so that the user is informed as much as possible during the payment process.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
Using the course material supplied by <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/">Code Institute</a> aswell as the Django & stripe documentation, I first constructed the Order and OrderItem models in the checkout app and peformed the migrations to setup the tables in the database. From there I could create the views and forms needed to allow the customer to input their details and process and order. Once these had been built, I setup the validation required by STRIPE in the stripe.js file to handle the creation of the stripe_id, which is required in order to process a payment with the API.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test the checkout feature, I first needed to add a selection of products to the cart and head over to the checkout.html page, I then entered dummy contact information and used stripe test card details (which can be found <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/testing">here</a>) to attempt to create a purchase, I also tested this feature with incorrect payment information in order to check that the error messages were visible, clear and in a good place for the user to see so that they are informed throughout the process.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
The payment was processed and using the stripe dashboard I could see that stripe had processed a dummy payment for the products that were in the cart.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.

<strong>'Latest Products' Carousel</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
As an added extra for the website I wanted to construct a sliding 'latest-products' carousel using the slick.js library, whilst this isnt actually displaying the 'latest-products' it is showing a list of products in a 'quick-look' fashion as an added extra to use across the website. Being familiar with the slick.js library this wasn't going to be that much of a challenge.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
To implement this feature I had to make sure that the products from the database were available within the view where I wanted to render the carousel, I setup the slick.js file and included the code for the carousel, making sure to vary the amount of products shown on different device types.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test this feature I navigated to the home page, (one of the places where this feature is rendered), and looked to see if the products were rendered with the settings specified in the slick.js file.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
The products were rendered in a sliding carousel with the settings specified in the slick.js file.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.

<strong>Profile Dashboard (orders & edit account information)</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
I wanted to develop a profile dashboard in which a user could access information about the items they had purchased, and the orders they had made. Also this would be the place in which the user could edit information about themselves.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
To implement this feature I had to interact with the Order and OrderItem model in the checkout app, looping through each order in the database and pulling out the orders that match the current logged in users id, then within the template looping over each order.item to render the order in the dashboard. In terms of editing the user details, I had to create a form that would update the user details in the User table based on the information inputted.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test the orders section of the profile dashboard, I first had to place a dummy order through the website so that there was information stored in the database to render in the HTML. I then navigated to the orders section in the dashboard. To test editing the user information I filled in the form with a new 'Name' and 'Surname' on the account information section and hit the edit details button.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
When I navigated to the orders section, I could see that the order I had previously placed was rendered with all the relevant information, to check that this was only viewable by my account, I created a test account to check to see if the order was visible and it wasnt. Upon submitting the user details form, I checked the details rendered in the HTML and could see that the values in the database had been updated.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.

<strong>Search Bar</strong>
- <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: 
I wanted to develop an intuitive search feature for the website, so that the user could search for products based on a custom string. This is often an expected feature in e-commerce sites in the modern day so was quite high in terms of importance on my list of features to develop. 

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: 
I developed a view in the search app that fetches a product based on the query that is collected by the search form. The product(s) if there are multiple are then returned to the HTML so that the user can see what items are returned on their query, I used an if statement to return a 'no-results' page with the passed query so that the user can see there were no products returned for that query.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™: 
To test the search function I had to input various search queries into the search bar and hit enter, I intentionally searched for products I knew existed and also typed in queries that would not return products.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: 
When searching for "coffee" all 7 products returned as at the time of performing this test all the products in the database had the name value of "Coffer (number)". When searching for "Lion" or "Gazelle", the 'no-results.html' page was rendered and I could see that the website was not able to serve any products based on those queries.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: 
This test passed based on the above criteria and information.
