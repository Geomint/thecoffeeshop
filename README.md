## User Experience: 👍

### Project Goals:
<p>The goal of this project is to offer a wide range of coffee products be it ground coffee, coffee beans or even products & merchandise. The users on the website will be able to create an account, add any combination of items
to a shopping basket, make payments and have their orders viewable on their profile dashboard panel.</p>

### Target Audience Goals:

* Browse various coffee products and be offered information about that product.
* Purchase products shown on the webstore.
* Create an account to track orders and purchase items on the webstore.
* A visually appealing and intuitive design.
* A website that is navigable on any device (mobile/tablet/desktop).
* Track orders made via profile dashboard.

### Site Owner Goals:

* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Encourage user sales with promotions and discounts.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract coffee suppliers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.

### User Stories:

<p>Tim Says: "Ive been looking for a website for a while now that works just as well on my phone as it does my laptop, im far too busy to be sitting at my computer all day 
so I need a site that I can use just as well on my phone."</p>

<p>Mark Says: "Im often skeptical of purchasing on online sites, I like to know that I have a line of communication with the company im paying with just incase there would be an issue
at some point down the line with the order."</p>

<p>Gabe Says: "Shopping on an e-commerce website has got to be easy, if you flood the user with too much choice you can cause them to panic and potentially leave the site and go elsewhere,
make it easy for the user to choose which items they want and buy them, simple!"</p>

### User Requirements and Expectations:
<p>When it comes to shopping on the web, users need to feel safe & comfortable in order for them to actually go through with purchases online, therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication
and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.</p>
